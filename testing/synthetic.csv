The bestselling novel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1963.  Faulkner previously won this award for his book ""A Fable"", making him one of only three authors to be awarded it more than once.  Unlike many of his earlier works, it is a straightforward narration and eschews the complicated literary techniques of his more well known works.  It is a picaresque novel, and as such may seem uncharacteristically lighthearted given its subject matter.  For these reasons, ""The Reivers"" is often ignored by Faulkner scholars or dismissed as a lesser work.  He previously had referred to writing a ""Golden Book of Yoknapatawpha County"" with which he would finish his literary career.  It is likely that ""The Reivers"" was meant to be this ""Golden Book"".

For 27 years, when not on TV, these pets were often looked after by ""Blue Peter""\'s long-standing pet keeper Edith Menezes, who died in 1994.  The first pet was a dog named Petra in 1962, and since then there have been several dogs, cats, tortoises, and parrots, and horses Joe And Simon.  The current animals on the show are Shelley the tortoise and Iggy the trainee guide dog puppy.  Rags, a pony, named by viewers, was purchased with the proceeds of a Christmas appeal in the late 1970s as a Riding for the Disabled horse.

In a 1986 documentary shown on BBC2 as part of the Did You See...?  series, former presenter Peter Purves recalled that Biddy Baxter, the show\'s editor, had called him in floods of tears the day the first parrot Joey died.  He went on to muse in the same interview that had he himself died, Baxter would have been far less upset.  The original ideas behind featuring the programme\'s pets were to teach viewers who had animals of their own how to look after them, and for the creatures to act as surrogate pets for those that did not own any.  For example, dog training items, tortoise hibernation, and cat care are often featured on the programme; however, the keeping of rabbits and mice was deemed not suitable as they do not live long.

For example, Voltaire sought the presentation of static tableaus that expressed emotion, as in the first act of the 1737 version which begins at the scene of Castor\'s tomb with a Chorus of Spartans singing ""Que tout gemisse"", followed by a recitative between Telaire and Phoebe in which the former is grieving the loss of her lover Castor, and culminating in Telaire\'s lament aria ""Tristes apprets"".

The events in Act I of the 1737 version appear in Act II of the 1754 version.  Dill claims that Voltaire was more interested in music than action in opera.  Moreover, Dill notes a difference in the plots between in the two versions.  In the 1737 version, the main concern is for the moral dilemma between love and duty that Pollux faces: should he pursue his love of Telaira or rescue his brother?  Of course, he chooses the latter.

The Old Ones are fictional deities in the World of Greyhawk campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy roleplaying game.

During the early 1970s, Pakistan was the world\'s fourth largest producer of feature films.  However, between 1977 and 2007, the film industry of Pakistan went into decline due to Islamization, strengthening of censorship laws and an overall lack of quality.

By 2007, the wounds of Pakistan\'s collapsed film industry began to heal and Karachi had cemented itself as the centre of Pakistani cinema.

It is an area of shallow lagoons and reedbeds acting as a spillway for the River Chet.  Tidal muds attract a range of wading birds and the undisturbed reedbeds support nesting wildfowl and other fenland birds, including nationally important breeding populations of shoveller, pochard and gadwall.  Hardley Flood was formed when agricultural land was flooded in the 1940s, and can be reached either by the footpath along the north bank of the River Chet from Loddon, or by boat as the River Chet is part of the navigable river system of the Norfolk Broads.']"," The context information still does not provide enough information to determine the specific animal that Hardley Flood supports populations of.  However, it does mention that the Wetland Management District has seen an increase in waterfowl populations for many species since the implementation of the Conservation Reserve Program.  It is possible that Hardley Flood supports populations of a medium sized version of one of these waterfowl species.  The context information also mentions that the Missouri River Slope has soils that are highly erodible and that much of the land was once farmed before being retired to Conservation Reserve Program grasslands.  This information suggests that Hardley Flood may be a body of water located in a grassland area that was once farmed.  It is possible that Hardley Flood supports populations of a medium sized version of a waterfowl species that is common in grassland areas.","['Salt Lagoon Islands Conservation Park is a protected area covering two islands and some adjoining waters in Salt Lagoon at the south east extent of Lake Alexandrina in South Australia about 14 km south-west of Narrung.

Headquarters for the Wetland Management District is located in the Long Lake National Wildlife Refuge office near Moffit, North Dakota, which is about 35 miles southeast of Bismarck.  Topographical landforms of the area include Missouri Coteau and Missouri River Slope.  Precipitation averages just under 16 inches per year.  Approximately 68 percent of the land in the three county area remains virgin sod - native mixed-grass prairie.  The dominant land use is cattle grazing.  The Coteau wetlands found in the northeastern portion of the Wetland Management District are classic prairie potholes of various sizes and types that are prime duck production habitat.  These areas, when wet, are very productive.  Soils in this area are generally deep and quite productive.  Due to the rolling nature of the landscape on the Coteau, a lot of the land is also characterized as highly erodible.  Conversely, many of the wetlands on Missouri River Slope portion of the Wetland Management District are large semi-permanent and permanent alkali wetlands.  There are 21 wetland sites on the Missouri River Slope that have a history of periodic avian botulism outbreaks.  These areas occasionally present localized problems for significant numbers of migratory birds.  Soils on the Missouri River Slope are characteristically shallow with high proportions of sand and gravel.  Much of the land is highly erodible.  Since 1985, substantial land acreage in the three county area that was once farmed has been retired to Conservation Reserve Program grasslands.  The program has assisted in restoring waterfowl populations for many species in the Wetland Management District which exceed the highest level ever recorded since surveys began.']",0,0.125,0,1
